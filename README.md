# Python Queue Implementation

A Python-based implementation of a dynamic queue structure using linked nodes. This project demonstrates the fundamental operations of a queue, including enqueue, dequeue, and peek, with an interactive CLI.

## Features
- **Dynamic Queue Management** â€“ Add, remove, and inspect elements dynamically.
- **Node-Based Structure** â€“ Built with a custom `Node` class for modularity.
- **Interactive CLI** â€“ Manage the queue through an easy-to-use command-line interface.
- **Error Handling** â€“ Handles edge cases like empty queues gracefully.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Python-Queue-Implementation.git
   cd Python-Queue-Implementation
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python3 queue.py
   ```

## How to Use
1. Launch the program.
2. Use the menu options to:
   - Add elements to the queue (`enqueue`).
   - Remove elements from the queue (`dequeue`).
   - Peek at the first element.
   - Check the size of the queue.
   - Verify if the queue is empty.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to manage the queue interactively.

### Example Menu:
```
1. LÃ¤gg till vÃ¤rde
2. Ta bort vÃ¤rde
3. Kolla pÃ¥ nÃ¤sta vÃ¤rde
4. Storlek
5. Empty?
6. Quit
```
